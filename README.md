# Bikeshare-Machine-Learning

Machine Learning approacht through Linear Regression models. Using intensive Data Exploration Analysis, correlation analysis, and feature engineering, robust models were contruct to estimate number of bike rentals on a particular time. GridSearchCV was used to attain the best fitting model which indicated Linear models with above average mean test scores.
